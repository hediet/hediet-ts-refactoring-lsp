See [README.md of the extension](./vscode-extension/README.md).

You can get the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.hediet-ts-lsp).

The refactorings are also useable without the VS Code plugin - you can use the [language service plugin](./language-service-plugin) standalone.
Just install `@hediet/ts-lsp` and add it as plugin to your `tsconfig.json`.
